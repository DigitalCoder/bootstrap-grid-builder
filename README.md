<h1>BootStrap 3 Grid Builder</h1>

<h2><a href="http://jaykanakiya.com/bootstrap-grid-builder/" title="bootstrap layout generator">DEMO</a></h2>

A quick layout generator for Bootstrap 3.

The Bootstrap 3 Grid System enables to quickly create responsive layouts .
I have created this to quickly test layouts on all types of devices fast.
You can increase widths and offsets and add rows / cols .
The main advantage is to test that layout on all screen sizes .

<ul class="unstyled" id="notes">
  <li>Please refer <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid">Bootstrap 3 Grid System</a></li>
  <li>Following optimizations are made automatically</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If the larger size has the same width or offset as the prev ones , delete the larger ones</li>
    <li>i.e. if xs has got the same col size as sm , then class for sm is automatically divided</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
